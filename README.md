# bulk Jira Cloud sprint creation

A Windows PowerShell script that enables creating multiple Jira Cloud sprints in one or many different projects!

Why would you want to do this? It's time consuming and error prone manually creating sprints as a Scrum Master or a Release Train Engineer. Using this script you can create a virtually unlimited number of sprints with a consistennt naming standard in minutes.

Full set up instructions are included in the script file. An accompanying PowerShell script is included "create-encoded-token.ps1" to enable creation of the API security token needed to authorise sprint creation.

Enjoy!
